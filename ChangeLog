2.01, September 2019  *  A new version of COMER introducing new data structures
and algorithms to provide extremely fast computation on GPU
2.02, November 2019  *  A more efficient computational load distribution,
practically removing stalls arising due to waiting for data from the CPU to arrive
2.02.03, March 2020  *  The option of making masked profile positions 
uninformative has been added; it is on by default
2.02.04, February 2021  *  JSON format for search results made available; Skipping
of GPUs with no free memory or those that cannot be queried has been implemented;
A program for calculating the effective number of sequences in an MSA has been 
added; bug fix when the profile size perfectly aligns with the file page size;
bug fix for uniquely determining profle end when reading multiple of them;
2.03.01, May 2021  *  Multiple database search implemented;
2.03.02, September 2021  *  Skipping (large) Db profiles with which alignment is 
impossible due to memory limit; Taking memory alignment size into consideration 
when calculating the size of the data to be transferred
2.03.03, September 2022  *  Bug fix in calculating initial memory padding (never 
happens by the driver allocation model, but still...); memory alignment of all 
fields taken into account when allocating space for db profiles in the beginning
